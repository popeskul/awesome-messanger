# ADR: Friend Service Architecture

## Context
The Friend Service is responsible for managing friend relationships, including sending, accepting, and rejecting friend requests.

## Decision
We will design the Friend Service using a microservice architecture, with PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing friend relationships.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Clear separation of concerns.
    - Scalable and maintainable service.
    - Strong consistency for friend relationship data.
- **Negative**:
    - Requires careful management of friend requests and concurrency.
    - Potentially complex interactions with other services.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Easier to implement initially but harder to scale and maintain.
- **NoSQL Database**: Better scalability but less suitable for strong consistency requirements.

## Implementation
We will implement the Friend Service with RESTful APIs, using PostgreSQL for data storage and Kafka for event publishing.
