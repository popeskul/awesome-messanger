# ADR: Use Kafka for Asynchronous Messaging

## Context
We need a reliable and scalable messaging solution for asynchronous communication between services. The solution should support high throughput and fault tolerance.

## Decision
We will use Apache Kafka as the messaging system for asynchronous communication.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - High throughput for both publishing and subscribing.
    - Fault-tolerant and durable.
    - Supports real-time processing and stream processing.
- **Negative**:
    - Requires operational expertise to maintain.
    - Can have high latency in certain scenarios.

## Alternatives Considered
- **RabbitMQ**: Easier to set up but less scalable for very high throughput.
- **ActiveMQ**: Similar to RabbitMQ but with different feature sets.

## Implementation
We will set up a Kafka cluster, configure topics for different events, and integrate it with our services for event-driven communication.
