# ADR: Message Service Architecture

## Context
The Message Service is responsible for handling the sending and receiving of messages between users.

## Decision
We will design the Message Service using a microservice architecture, with Cassandra as the primary database for storing messages.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - High write and read throughput.
    - Supports horizontal scaling.
    - High availability and fault tolerance.
- **Negative**:
    - Eventual consistency model.
    - Complex maintenance and operations.

## Alternatives Considered
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance but less suitable for high write throughput.
- **MongoDB**: Better horizontal scaling but lacks the same level of fault tolerance as Cassandra.

## Implementation
We will implement the Message Service with RESTful APIs, using Cassandra for data storage and Kafka for event publishing.
