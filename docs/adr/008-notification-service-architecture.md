# ADR: Notification Service Architecture

## Context
The Notification Service is responsible for sending notifications to users about various events (e.g., new messages, friend requests).

## Decision
We will design the Notification Service using a microservice architecture, with Kafka for message queueing and a suitable notification system for delivering messages.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Decouples notification logic from other services.
    - Scalable and maintainable service.
    - Can support multiple notification channels (e.g., email, push notifications).
- **Negative**:
    - Requires integration with external notification systems.
    - Potentially complex interactions with other services.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Easier to implement initially but harder to scale and maintain.

## Implementation
We will implement the Notification Service with RESTful APIs, using Kafka for message queueing and integrating with external notification providers.
