# ADR: Notification Service Architecture

## Context
The Notification Service is responsible for sending notifications to users about various events such as new messages and friend requests. This service must be scalable, reliable, and capable of handling multiple notification channels (e.g., email, push notifications).

## Decision
We will design the Notification Service using a microservice architecture, with Apache Kafka for message queueing to handle event-driven notifications and a suitable notification system for delivering messages.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Decouples notification logic from other services.
    - Scalable and maintainable service. 
    - Supports multiple notification channels.
- **Negative**:
    - Requires integration with external notification systems. 
    - Potentially complex interactions with other services. 

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Easier to implement initially but harder to scale and maintain.
  
## Implementation
We will implement the Notification Service with RESTful APIs, using Kafka for message queueing and integrating with external notification providers such as AWS SNS for push notifications and SendGrid for email notifications.
