# ADR: Profile Service Architecture

## Context
The Profile Service is responsible for managing user profiles, including personal information, avatars, and bio.

## Decision
We will design the Profile Service using a microservice architecture, with PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing profile information.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
    - Clear separation of concerns.
    - Scalable and maintainable service.
    - Strong consistency for profile data.
- **Negative**:
    - Requires careful management of profile updates and concurrency.
    - Potentially complex interactions with other services.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Easier to implement initially but harder to scale and maintain.
- **NoSQL Database**: Better scalability but less suitable for strong consistency requirements.

## Implementation
We will implement the Profile Service with RESTful APIs, using PostgreSQL for data storage and Kafka for event publishing.
