# ADR: Auth Service Architecture

## Context
The Auth Service is responsible for user authentication and authorization, including registration, login, and token management.

## Decision
We will design the Auth Service using a microservice architecture, with PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing user credentials and tokens.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Clear separation of concerns.
  - Scalable and maintainable service.
  - Strong consistency for authentication data.
- **Negative**:
  - Requires careful management of tokens and security.
  - Potentially complex interactions with other services.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Easier to implement initially but harder to scale and maintain.
- **NoSQL Database**: Better scalability but less suitable for strong consistency requirements.

## Implementation
We will implement the Auth Service with RESTful APIs, using JWT for token management and PostgreSQL for data storage.
